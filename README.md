# odin-recipes

Odin recipes is the first learning exercise for The Odin Project - an online open source course to learn full-stack web development.

This first project aims to learn the basics of HTML.

During this project, I have learned to create HTML pages from scratch, create links between the different pages as well as links to an external website. Furthermore, I have learned to create a basic HTML structure with headings, lists, and images. Finally, by posting this exercise to GitHub, the basics of Git and GitHub as well as commit messages have been part of this project.
